# Demo

### Tianyu is an encouraging teacher. He rewards his elementary school kids points for performing well. He decides to use kid's mini shop to lists gifts for the kids to buy with their points.

### Tianyu logs into his teacher-account. The default "points" icon is a star. Wow! A star is cool, Tianyu thinks.
### But, I want to use a cooked chicken leg icon for their points. My students love that food. They will be happier to collect chicken legs than stars.
### Decision is made. Tianyu clicks on the Change Emoji button, copy-paste the chicken leg emoji from online, and hit the Change button.
### Boom. The icon has changed! Now all students under Tianyu will be able to see the chicken leg as their "currency".
