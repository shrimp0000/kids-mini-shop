## -- Teacher Managing Shop --

### Tianyu is an encouraging teacher. He rewards his elementary school kids points for performing well. He decides to use kid's mini shop to lists gifts for the kids to buy with their points.

### Tianyu logs into his teacher-account. He finds out the default "points" icon is a star. He changes the icon to a chicken leg because his students love it.

### Now Tianyu is adding some lovely gift items into his shop. He carefully sets up the images, price, stock, description, and etc.

### He has students Harry and Dinner. He gives both of them 20 chicken legs for being good in the class and logs out. Wyatt is also a student but he is not under Tianyu. So Tianyu cannot reward him.

## -- Student Buying Items --

### Harry is teacher Tianyu's student. He logs into his student-account. He finds out he has 20 eggs and opens the store. He buys the item, and moves to his cart and checkout the item. Now the item is on delivery!

### Dinner is also teacher Tianyu's student. He buys the item and follows the same procedure as Harry. Wyatt is not teacher Tianyu's student. Oops! It seems that his teacher hasn't given him any points or added any items to the store yet.

## -- Confirm the Purchase --

### Tianyu checks the orders. He already gives the item to Harry, so he confirms the delivery. Now Harry won't be able to see his order because it is delivered. Dinner still sees and waits for his item to arrive.
